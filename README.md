# ðŸ˜Ž Rust implementation of arithmetics of supersingular elliptic curves
## Objectives
+ Supersingular elliptic curve point operations
+ Isogeny computation
+ Endomorphism computation
+ Deuring correspondence
+ Hyperelliptic curve point operations(genus-2)
+ Isogeny computation between hyperelliptic curves

# Types To Be Implemented

+ Polynomial with field coefficient
+ Extended finite field
+ Supersingular elliptic curve & point(projective/affine)
+ Quaternion algebra
    + Ideal, Order, etc..

# Dependencies
